## Notes
- Link for the assignment is here : https://tigasatutiga.com
- There are some tools you can access : -
 1. [Traefik](https://traefik.tigasatutiga.com) u: mulan, p:mulan
 2. [Portainer](https://portainer.tigasatutiga.com) u: admin, p:adminadminadmin
 3. [Authelia](https://auth.tigasatutiga.com) auth: upon request

- Authelia somehow I can't add new user through recompose another container, instead I disable it for all authentication. Thus, if you need to look at it (prove that image is running), you need navigate to https://auth.tigasatutiga.com or check the stacks at https://portainer.tigasatutiga.com. 

- This hosting will be valid for a month only, due to AWS limited Free Tier usage. It valid for 12 month but uptime is just for 700++ hours (1 month equivalent)

- Every tools here were spinned using docker.

- For the webserver, I'm using nginx, both front and back end of this project. front end is using traditional html method (Angular) and back end using proxy pass method (Node.js).
